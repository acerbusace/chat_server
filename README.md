## About the badge

[I](https://github.com/yeskunall) didn't want to use [![Wercker](https://img.shields.io/wercker/ci/wercker/docs.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=flat-square)]() because at this time, no tests are being conducted on our application. However, in the near future, I plan on testing this app fully.
